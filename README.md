# Reformulating Unsupervised Style Transfer as Paraphrase Generation (EMNLP 2020)

This is the official repository accompanying the EMNLP 2020 long paper [Reformulating Unsupervised Style Transfer as Paraphrase Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05700). This repository contains the accompanying dataset and codebase.

This repository is a work-in-progress, but we have released a pretrained model for our diverse paraphrase generation system, along with a command-line demo to play with it! For more details, check [`README_DEMO.md`](README_DEMO.md).
