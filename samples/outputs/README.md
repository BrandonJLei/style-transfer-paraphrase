## Style Transferred Outputs

We style transfer each of the 1000 sentences in [`../data_samples`](../data_samples) to every other style and provide the outputs. These HTML files are best viewed using a browser. **WARNING**: These samples have not been filtered by profanity / toxicity and some sentences might contain expletives or disturbing content since the original dataset contained them. We recognize this issue and plan to discuss this at length before releasing our style transfer models.
